      feature-complete development environment for Coq
      projects.

      Features
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Eclipse integration
        <p>
          Coqoon works well with other Eclipse
          plugins &mdash; add more to add new
          features like version control or support
          for embedded OCaml plugins.
      <li>
        Automatic project builder
        <p>
          Automatically rebuild dependencies when
          proof scripts change, and forget about
          manual load path configuration.
      <li>
        Java-style project organisation
        <p>
          Structure Coq developments like Java
          projects, manage project
          interdependencies with a user
          interface, and avoid cluttering source
          folders with <code>.vo</code> files.
      <li>
        Compatibility with other tools
        <p>
          All Coqoon projects come with a <code>configure</code>
          script, so they can be built and developed even without
          using Coqoon.
      <li>
        The latest Coq features
        <p>
          Coqoon takes advantage of all the latest changes
          to Coq: edit proofs asynchronously and get automatic
          feedback, or use the quick compilation chain to compile
          a colossal project in just a few minutes.

      Coq
    </h3>
    <p>
      In order to use Coqoon's PIDE support, you'll need a recent version of
      Coq 8.5. A prebuilt binary will soon be available for
      Windows users; for other platforms, the most recent source code can be
      found and
      downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/coq/coq/tree/v8.5">the GitHub
      development page for the v8.5 branch</a>.
    <p class="warning">
      Note that Coqoon is not compatible with the most recent release in the
      8.5 series, Coq 8.5beta2, as it depends on features added since that
      release.
    <h3 id="requirements-pidetop">
      PIDEtop
    </h3>
    <p>
      Once you've installed Coq 8.5, download and install the latest version
      of the PIDEtop plugin. A prebuilt binary will soon be available is
      available for Windows users; for other platforms, it should be built from <a href="https://bitbucket.org/coqpide/pidetop/get/PIDEtop.tar.gz">the
      latest version of the source code</a>. (When building PIDEtop, note that the trailing
      slash in the <code>COQBIN</code> variable <em>is required</em>.)
    <p>
      See <a href="https://bitbucket.org/coqpide/pidetop">the PIDEtop

    <p>
      As the examples are hosted in a Git repository, we recommend a
      package that includes Git support out of the box, such as
      <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/lunasr1a">the
      Eclipse IDE for Java Developers</a>.

    <h3 id="configuration-finding">
      Finding the Coq program
    </h3>
    <p>
      Coqoon will search some system folders for Coq, but if
      it can't find it&mdash;or if it finds the wrong
      version&mdash;you may need to manually
      specify the the folder that contains the
      <span class="shell">coqtop</span> program.
    <p>
      To specify the path, select the
      <span class="ui">Window &rarr; Preferences</span> (or
      <span class="ui">Eclipse &rarr; Preferences</span> on
      Mac OS X) menu option, choose the <span class="ui">Coqoon</span>
      category, and then click <span class="ui">Browse</span>
      to choose the correct folder.
    <img class="block" src="configuration.png" />
    <p class="warning">
      If you're using Coqoon with OCaml integration, note that OcaIDE ignores
      this setting, and will only
      look for Coq in your configured path, or in the folder specified by the
      <span class="shell">COQBIN</span> environment variable. (We expect to
      fix this issue
      soon.)

      Enabling the Coq perspective

      The default Eclipse user interface configuration does
      not show any Coq-specific views. To enable these,
      select the <span class="ui">Window &rarr; Open
      Perspective &rarr; Other...</span> menu option, choose
      <span class="ui">Coq</span>, and click <span class="ui">OK</span>.

      We also provide a version of <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/index.html">Benjamin Pierce's <em>Software
      Foundations</em> course</a>, modified to be compatible with the Coq 8.5
      series. The easiest way to import it is to use Eclipse's integrated Git
      support:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Right-click in the Project Explorer and choose <span class="ui">Import</span>.
      <li>
        Choose the <span class="ui">Git &rarr; Project from Git</span> option.
      <li>
        Choose the <span class="ui">Clone URI</span> option.
      <li>
        Paste <span class="shell">https://github.com/coqoon/Software-Foundations.git</span>
        into the URI text box, and press <span class="ui">Finish</span>.
    </ol>
    <p>
      This process will create a local copy of the Software
      Foundations repository on your computer; to import the
      project again, you should use this local copy directly
      by choosing the <span class="ui">Existing local
      repository</span> option instead of <span class="ui">Clone
      URI</span>.
    <p>
      To fetch updates from the Software Foundations repository
      and incorporate them into your local copy,
      open the <span class="ui">Git Repositories</span> view
      (<span class="ui">Window &rarr; Show View &rarr; Other...
      &rarr; Git &rarr; Git Repositories</span>), right-click

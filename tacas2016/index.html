			Coqoon
		</h1>
		<p>
			Coqoon is an Eclipse plugin providing a
			feature-complete development environment for Coq proof
			scripts.
		<img class="block" src="../screen.png" />
<!--		<h2 id="features">
			Features
		</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Eclipse integration
				<p>
					Coqoon works well with other Eclipse
					plugins &mdash; add more to add new
					features like version control.
			<li>
				Automatic project builder
				<p>
					Automatically rebuild dependencies when
					proof scripts change, and forget about
					manual load path configuration.
			<li>
				Java-style project organisation
				<p>
					Structure Coq developments like Java
					projects, manage project
					interdependencies with a user
					interface, and avoid cluttering source
					folders with <code>.vo</code> files.
			<li>
				Compatibility with other tools
				<p>
					All Coqoon projects come with a <code>configure</code>
					script, so they can be built and modified without needing
					to use Coqoon itself.
		</ul>

			Requirements
		</h2>
		<h3 id="requirements-coq">
			Coq
		</h3>
		<p>
			In order to use Coqoon's PIDE support, you'll need Coq 8.5,
			the first beta release of which is currently available from
			<a href="https://coq.inria.fr/coq-85">the Coq downloads page</a>.
		<p class="warning">
			Note that Coq 8.5 is <strong>still in beta</strong> at the time
			of writing, and that bugs are known to exist in the asynchronous
			proof backend used by PIDE. We recommend that Coqoon users
			stay up-to-date with new releases of Coq 8.5.
		<p>
		<h3 id="requirements-pidetop">
			PIDEtop
		</h3>
		<p>
			Once you've installed Coq 8.5, download and install version
			<code>Coq-0.2.0</code>
			of PIDEtop. A <a href="https://bitbucket.org/coqpide/pidetop/downloads/pidetop-windows-0.2.0.zip">prebuilt
			binary</a> is available for Windows users; users of Mac OS X or
			Linux should compile it from <a href="https://bitbucket.org/coqpide/pidetop/get/Coq-0.2.0.tar.gz">the
			source code</a>. (When building PIDEtop, note that the trailing
			slash in the <code>COQBIN</code> variable <em>is required</em>.)
		<p>
			See <a href="https://bitbucket.org/coqpide/pidetop">the PIDEtop
			installation instructions</a> for more details.
		<p class="warning">
			Make sure you're using the <code>Coq-0.2.0</code> release of
			PIDEtop; later versions are known to contain bugs that interfere
			with Coqoon.
		<p>
		<h3 id="requirements-java">
			Java
		</h3>
		<p>
			Coqoon should work with any recent version of the Java
			virtual machine. See <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp">Oracle's
			Java downloads page</a>.
		<h3 id="requirements-eclipse">
			Eclipse
		</h3>
		<p>
			Coqoon requires version 4.2 (Juno) or later of Eclipse,
			available from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">the
			Eclipse downloads page</a>.
		<p>
			As the examples are hosted in a Git repository, we recommend a
			package that includes Git support out of the box, such as
			<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/lunasr1a">the
			Eclipse IDE for Java Developers</a>.
		<h3 id="requirements-os">
			Operating systems
		</h3>
		<p>
			Coqoon is tested regularly on Windows, Mac OS X and
			Linux.

		<h2 id="updating">
			Updating
		</h2>
		<p>
			New versions of Coqoon are released frequently to add
			new features, fix bugs, and improve performance. To
			update Coqoon to the most recent version, select the
			<span class="ui">Help &rarr; Check for Updates</span>
			menu option.
		<p>
			The most recent version of Coqoon is v0.5.7, released
			on March 2nd, 2015; for more information, see
			<a href="https://github.com/hannesm/Kopitiam/blob/master/CHANGES.md">the Coqoon changelog</a>.
		<h2 id="configuration">
			Configuration
		</h2>
		<h3 id="configuration-finding">
			Finding the Coq program
		</h3>
		<p>
			Coqoon will search some system folders for Coq, but if
			it can't find it&mdash;or if it finds an older version
			without PIDE support&mdash;you may need to manually
			specify the path to the <span class="shell">coqtop</span>
			program.
		<p>
			To specify the path, select the
			<span class="ui">Window &rarr; Preferences</span> (or
			<span class="ui">Eclipse &rarr; Preferences</span> on
			Mac OS X) menu option, choose the <span class="ui">Coqoon</span>
			category, and then click <span class="ui">Browse</span>
			to choose the correct folder.
		<img class="block" src="configuration.png" />
		<h3 id="configuration-perspective">
			Enabling the Coq perspective
		</h3>
		<p>
			The default Eclipse user interface configuration does
			not show any Coq-specific views. To enable these,
			select the <span class="ui">Window &rarr; Open
			Perspective &rarr; Other...</span> menu option, choose
			<span class="ui">Coq</span>, and click <span class="ui">OK</span>.
		<h3 id="configuration-annotations">
			Toggling PIDE annotations
		</h3>
		<p>
			The Coq editor can optionally display commands that are
			awaiting execution using a different background colour,
			providing the user with more immediate feedback.
		<p>
			To enable or disable this option, select the
			<span class="ui">Window &rarr; Preferences</span> (or
			<span class="ui">Eclipse &rarr; Preferences</span> on
			Mac OS X) menu option, choose the <span class="ui">Coqoon
			&rarr; Interface</span>
			category, and then click the <span class="ui">Enable
			PIDE processing annotations (experimental)</span> checkbox.
		<h2 id="software-foundations">
			Software Foundations	
		</h2>
		<p>
			We have modified a version of Benjamin Pierce's <i>Software Foundations</i> course to be compatible with the
			development version of Coq that Coqoon currently supports. The easiest way to obtain this project is
			to import it:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Right-click in the Project Explorer and choose <span class="ui">Import</span>.
			<li>
				Choose the <span class="ui">Git &rarr; Project from Git</span> option.
			<li>
				Choose the <span class="ui">Clone URI</span> option.
			<li>
				Paste <span class="shell">https://github.com/coqoon/Software-Foundations.git</span>
				into the URI text box, and press <span class="ui">Finish</span>.
		</ol>
		<p>
			This process will create a local copy of the Software
			Foundations repository on your computer; to import the
			project again, you should use this local copy directly
			by choosing the <span class="ui">Existing local
			repository</span> option instead of <span class="ui">Clone
			URI</span>.
		<p>
			To fetch updates from the Software Foundations repository
			and incorporate them into your local copy,
			open the <span class="ui">Git Repositories</span> view
			(<span class="ui">Window &rarr; Show View &rarr; Other...
			&rarr; Git &rarr; Git Repositories</span>), right-click
			the <span class="ui">Software-Foundations</span> entry,
			and click <span class="ui">Pull</span>.

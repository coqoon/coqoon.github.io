      Coqoon
    </h1>
    <p>
      Coqoon is an Eclipse plugin providing a
      feature-complete development environment for Coq
      projects.

    <h2 id="features">
      Features
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Eclipse integration
        <p>
          Coqoon works well with other Eclipse
          plugins &mdash; add more to add new
          features like version control or support
          for embedded OCaml plugins.
      <li>
        Automatic project builder
        <p>
          Automatically rebuild dependencies when
          proof scripts change, and forget about
          manual load path configuration.
      <li>
        Java-style project organisation
        <p>
          Structure Coq developments like Java
          projects, manage project
          interdependencies with a user
          interface, and avoid cluttering source
          folders with <code>.vo</code> files.
      <li>
        Compatibility with other tools
        <p>
          All Coqoon projects come with a <code>configure</code>
          script, so they can be built and developed even without
          using Coqoon.
      <li>
        The latest Coq features
        <p>
          Coqoon takes advantage of all the latest changes
          to Coq: edit proofs asynchronously and get automatic
          feedback, or use the quick compilation chain to compile
          a colossal project in just a few minutes.
    </ul>

    <h3 id="requirements-coq">
      Coq
    </h3>
    <p>
      In order to use Coqoon's PIDE support, you'll need to use
      <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/download">Coq 8.5</a>.
    <h3 id="requirements-pidetop">
      PIDEtop
    </h3>
    <p>
      Once you've installed Coq 8.5, download and install the latest version
      of the PIDEtop plugin. For Windows users, a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/coqpide/pidetop/downloads/pidetop-f23e3331-8.5pl2-win32.zip">binary
      version of the plugin for Coq 8.5pl2</a> is available; for other
      platforms, or for other versions of Coq, it should be built
      from <a href="https://bitbucket.org/coqpide/pidetop/get/PIDEtop.tar.gz">the
      latest version of the source code</a>. (When building PIDEtop, note that the trailing
      slash in the <code>COQBIN</code> variable <em>is required</em>.)
    <p class="information">
      Note that PIDEtop can also be installed using the OPAM integration
      feature; see the PIDEtop installation instructions for more details.
    <p>
      See <a href="https://bitbucket.org/coqpide/pidetop">the PIDEtop

    <h3>
      Compliance
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Coqoon repository contains a compiled copy of OcaIDE; in order to
      comply with its licence, we also make a copy of
      <a href="https://www.itu.dk/research/tomeso/coqoon/OcaIDE_20151021.zip">its source code</a>
      available.
    <h2 id="updating">
      Updating
    </h2>
    <p>
      New versions of Coqoon are released frequently to add
      new features, fix bugs, and improve performance. To
      update Coqoon to the most recent version, select the
      <span class="ui">Help &rarr; Check for Updates</span>
      menu option.
    <p>
      The most recent version of Coqoon is <strong>v0.8.1</strong>, released on
      <strong>August 10th, 2017</strong>; for more information, see

      Configuration
    </h2>
    <h3 id="configuration-finding">
      Finding the Coq program
    </h3>
    <p>
      Coqoon will search some system folders for Coq, but if
      it can't find it&mdash;or if it finds the wrong
      version&mdash;you may need to manually
      specify the the folder that contains the
      <span class="shell">coqtop</span> program.
    <p class="information">
      If you're using the OPAM integration feature, then the version of Coq
      installed in the active OPAM root will automatically be used.
    <p>
      To specify the path, select the
      <span class="ui">Window &rarr; Preferences</span> (or
      <span class="ui">Eclipse &rarr; Preferences</span> on
      Mac OS X) menu option, choose the <span class="ui">Coqoon</span>
      category, and then click <span class="ui">Browse</span>
      to choose the correct folder.
    <img class="block" src="configuration.png" />
    <p class="warning">
      If you're using Coqoon with OCaml integration, note that OcaIDE ignores
      this setting, and will only
      look for Coq in your configured path, or in the folder specified by the
      <span class="shell">COQBIN</span> environment variable. (We expect to
      fix this issue
      soon.)
    <h3 id="configuration-perspective">
      Enabling the Coq perspective
    </h3>
    <p>
      The default Eclipse user interface configuration does
      not show any Coq-specific views. To enable these,
      select the <span class="ui">Window &rarr; Open
      Perspective &rarr; Other...</span> menu option, choose
      <span class="ui">Coq</span>, and click <span class="ui">OK</span>.

    <h3>
      The Odd Order Theorem
    </h3>
    <p>
      To show that Coqoon can be used to work with even the most complex Coq
      projects, we
      provide <a href="https://www.itu.dk/research/tomeso/coqoon/odd-order_20151022.zip">a pre-packaged version</a>
      of <a href="http://www.msr-inria.fr/news/the-formalization-of-the-odd-order-theorem-has-been-completed-the-20-septembre-2012/">the
      Microsoft Research / INRIA formalisation of the odd order theorem</a>.
    <p>
      We recommend that this project be compiled using the quick compilation
      chain. To enable it, select the <span class="ui">Window &rarr;
      Preferences</span> (or
      <span class="ui">Eclipse &rarr; Preferences</span> on
      Mac OS X) menu option, choose the <span class="ui">Coqoon</span>
      category, and then tick the box labelled
      <span class="ui">Enable the quick compilation
      process (experimental, Coq 8.5+)</span>.
    <p class="warning">
      This project contains an embedded OCaml plugin, so the
      <span class="ui">OcaIDE integration for Coqoon</span> feature and its dependencies must be
      installed to build it correctly.
    <p>
      To import this project into Coqoon, follow these steps:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select the <span class="ui">File &rarr; Import...</span> menu option.
      <li>
        Choose the <span class="ui">General &rarr; Existing Projects into
        Workspace</span> option.
      <li>
        Click the <span class="ui">Select archive file:</span> radio button,
        then click the <span class="ui">Browse...</span> button.
      <li>
        Select the ZIP archive containing the project.
      <li>
        Click <span class="ui">Finish</span>.
    </ol>
    <h4>
      Compliance
    </h4>
    <p>
      The packaged version omits several non-Coq files from the Mathematical
      Components library; in order to comply with its licence, we also make a
      copy of
      <a href="https://www.itu.dk/research/tomeso/coqoon/math-comp_20151022.zip">the full source code</a>
      available.
    <h3>
      Software Foundations
    </h3>
    <p>
      We also provide a version of <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/index.html">Benjamin Pierce's <em>Software
      Foundations</em> course</a>, modified to be compatible with the Coq 8.5
      series. The easiest way to import it is to use Eclipse's integrated Git
      support:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Right-click in the Project Explorer and choose <span class="ui">Import</span>.
      <li>
        Choose the <span class="ui">Git &rarr; Project from Git</span> option.
      <li>
        Choose the <span class="ui">Clone URI</span> option.
      <li>
        Paste <span class="shell">https://github.com/coqoon/Software-Foundations.git</span>
        into the URI text box, and press <span class="ui">Finish</span>.
    </ol>
    <p>
      This process will create a local copy of the Software
      Foundations repository on your computer; to import the
      project again, you should use this local copy directly
      by choosing the <span class="ui">Existing local
      repository</span> option instead of <span class="ui">Clone
      URI</span>.
    <p>
      To fetch updates from the Software Foundations repository
      and incorporate them into your local copy,
      open the <span class="ui">Git Repositories</span> view
      (<span class="ui">Window &rarr; Show View &rarr; Other...
      &rarr; Git &rarr; Git Repositories</span>), right-click
      the <span class="ui">Software-Foundations</span> entry,
      and click <span class="ui">Pull</span>.

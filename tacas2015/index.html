			Coqoon
		</h1>
		<p>
			Coqoon is an Eclipse plugin providing a
			feature-complete development environment for Coq proof
			scripts.
		<p>
			Coqoon is developed alongside
			<a href="http://www.itu.dk/research/tomeso/kopitiam/">Kopitiam</a>,
			an Eclipse plugin for certifying full functional
			correctness of Java programs.

		<h2>
			Features
		</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Eclipse integration
				<p>
					Coqoon works well with other Eclipse
					plugins &mdash; add more to add new
					features like version control.
			<li>
				Automatic project builder
				<p>
					Automatically rebuild dependencies when
					proof scripts change, and forget about
					manual load path configuration.
			<li>
				Java-style project organisation
				<p>
					Structure Coq developments like Java
					projects, manage project
					interdependencies with a user
					interface, and avoid cluttering source
					folders with <code>.vo</code> files.
			<li>
				Compatibility with other tools
				<p>
					Coqoon projects can be built outside of
					Coqoon by using automatically-generated
					Makefiles.
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Requirements
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Coq
		</h3>
		<p>
			In order to use Coqoon's PIDE support, you will need a
			development version of Coq, which you'll need to build
			separately. To get a suitable version of Coq, run the
			following commands:
		<p class="shell">
			git clone https://github.com/coq/coq.git<br>
			cd coq<br>
			git checkout 6e0c5c81e9e81c2e5369427643b2ac51b9aa17e6
		<p>
			The latest version of Coq is also likely to work, but
			these commands will fetch an earlier version we have
			tested.
		<p>
			Next, follow the usual installation instructions for
			Coq. (You will need to have OCaml available to build
			it.) If you wish to install this branch locally, run
			<span class="shell">./configure -local</span>
			before running make.
		<p>
			Finally, to install the Coq plugin for PIDE, run the
			following commands (with the version of Coq you
			compiled earlier in your path):
		<p class="shell">
			git clone https://bitbucket.org/Carst/pidetop.git<br>
			cd pidetop<br>
			coq_makefile -f Make > Makefile<br>
			make<br>
			make install-toploop</br>
		<p>
			See <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Carst/pidetop">Carst
			Tankink's build instructions</a> for more information.
		<h3>
			Java
		</h3>
		<p>
			Coqoon should work with any recent version of the Java
			virtual machine. See <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp">Oracle's
			Java downloads page</a>.
		<h3>
			Eclipse
		</h3>
		<p>
			Coqoon requires version 4.2 (Juno) or later of Eclipse,
			available from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">the
			Eclipse downloads page</a>.
		<h3>
			Operating systems
		</h3>
		<p>
			Coqoon is tested regularly on Windows, Mac OS X and
			Linux.
		<h2>
			Installation
		</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Start Eclipse.
			<li>
				Select the <span class="ui">Help &rarr;
				Install New Software...</span> menu option.
			<li>
				Paste the line
				<pre class="block">Coqoon (PIDE) - https://www.itu.dk/research/tomeso/coqoon/e42-pide</pre>
				into the <span class="ui">Work with:</span>
				text box, and press Enter.
			<li>
				Select the <span class="ui">Coqoon (PIDE) &rarr;
				Coqoon</span> feature, and click
				<span class="ui">Next</span>.
			<li>
				Agree to the Coqoon licence agreement, and
				click <span class="ui">Next</span>.
		</ol>
		<h2>
			Updating
		</h2>
		<p>
			New versions of Coqoon are released frequently to add
			new features, fix bugs, and improve performance. To
			update Coqoon to the most recent version, select the
			<span class="ui">Help &rarr; Check for Updates</span>
			menu option.
		<p>
			The most recent version of Coqoon is v0.4.6.6, released
			on November 11th, 2014; for more information, see
			<a href="https://github.com/hannesm/Kopitiam/blob/master/CHANGES.md">the Coqoon changelog</a>.
		<h2>
			Configuration
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Finding the Coq program
		</h3>
		<p>
			Coqoon will search some system folders for Coq, but if
			it can't find it&mdash;or if it finds an older version
			without PIDE support&mdash;you may need to manually
			specify the path to the <span class="shell">coqtop</span>
			program.
		<p>
			To specify the path, select the
			<span class="ui">Window &rarr; Preferences</span> (or
			<span class="ui">Eclipse &rarr; Preferences</span> on
			Mac OS X) menu option, choose the <span class="ui">Coqoon</span>
			category, and then click <span class="ui">Browse</span>
			to choose the correct folder.
		<img class="block" src="configuration.png" />
		<h3>
			Enabling the Coq perspective
		</h3>
		<p>
			The default Eclipse user interface configuration does
			not show any Coq-specific views. To enable these,
			select the <span class="ui">Window &rarr; Open
			Perspective &rarr; Other...</span> menu option, choose
			<span class="ui">Coq</span>, and click <span class="ui">OK</span>.
		<h3>
			Toggling PIDE annotations
		</h3>
		<p>
			The Coq editor can optionally display commands that are
			awaiting execution using a different background colour,
			providing the user with more immediate feedback.
		<p>
			To enable or disable this option, select the
			<span class="ui">Window &rarr; Preferences</span> (or
			<span class="ui">Eclipse &rarr; Preferences</span> on
			Mac OS X) menu option, choose the <span class="ui">Coqoon
			&rarr; Interface</span>
			category, and then click the <span class="ui">Enable
			PIDE processing annotations (experimental)</span> checkbox.
		<h2>
			Software Foundations	
		</h2>
		<p>
			We have modified a version of Benjamin Pierce's <i>Software Foundations</i> course to be compatible with the
			development version of Coq that Coqoon currently supports. The easiest way to obtain this project is
			to import it:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Right-click in the Project Explorer and choose <span class="ui">Import</span>.
			<li>
				Choose the <span class="ui">Git &rarr; Project from Git</span> option.
			<li>
				Choose the <span class="ui">Clone URI</span> option.
			<li>
				Paste <span class="shell">https://github.com/coqoon/Software-Foundations.git</span>
				into the URI text box, and press <span class="ui">Finish</span>.
		</ol>
		<p>
			This process will create a local copy of the Software
			Foundations repository on your computer; to import the
			project again, you should use this local copy directly
			by choosing the <span class="ui">Existing local
			repository</span> option instead of <span class="ui">Clone
			URI</span>.
		<p>
			To fetch updates from the Software Foundations repository
			and incorporate them into your local copy,
			open the <span class="ui">Git Repositories</span> view
			(<span class="ui">Window &rarr; Show View &rarr; Other...
			&rarr; Git &rarr; Git Repositories</span>), right-click
			the <span class="ui">Software-Foundations</span> entry,
			and click <span class="ui">Pull</span>.

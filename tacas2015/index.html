			Coqoon
		</h1>
		<p>
			Coqoon is an Eclipse plugin providing a
			feature-complete development environment for Coq proof
			scripts.
		<p>
			Coqoon is developed alongside
			<a href="http://www.itu.dk/research/tomeso/kopitiam/">Kopitiam</a>,
			an Eclipse plugin for certifying full functional
			correctness of Java programs.

		<h2>
			Features
		</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Eclipse integration
				<p>
					Coqoon works well with other Eclipse
					plugins &mdash; add more to add new
					features like version control.
			<li>
				Automatic project builder
				<p>
					Automatically rebuild dependencies when
					proof scripts change, and forget about
					manual load path configuration.
			<li>
				Java-style project organisation
				<p>
					Structure Coq developments like Java
					projects, manage project
					interdependencies with a user
					interface, and avoid cluttering source
					folders with <code>.vo</code> files.
			<li>
				Compatibility with other tools
				<p>
					Coqoon projects can be built outside of
					Coqoon by using automatically-generated
					Makefiles.
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Requirements
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Coq
		</h3>
		<p>
			In order to use Coqoon's PIDE support, you will need a
			development version of Coq, which you'll need to build
			separately. Once you have an appropriate version of
			Coq, you'll need to build the PIDEtop plug-in for it.
			See <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Carst/coq-pide/src/944d86af9318750330d568dcb74d0455ddae1be1/?at=PIDEtop">Carst
			Tankink's build instructions</a> for more information.
		<p>
			(It is not necessary to build PIDE itself; Coqoon
			includes a supported snapshot of the PIDE client.)
		<p>
		<h3>
			Java
		</h3>
		<p>
			Coqoon should work with any recent version of the Java
			virtual machine. See <a href=https://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp">Oracle's
			Java downloads page</a>.
		<h3>
			Eclipse
		</h3>
		<p>
			Coqoon requires version 4.2 (Juno) or later of Eclipse,
			available from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">the
			Eclipse downloads page</a>.
		<h3>
			Operating systems
		</h3>
		<p>
			Coqoon is tested regularly on Windows, Mac OS X and
			Linux.
